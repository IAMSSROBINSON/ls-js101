# Review: Objects VS Primitive values

- every value in JavaScript is either object or primitive
- primitives are atomic values in that they cannot be broken down further
- objects are compound values made up of other primitives and / or objects
- primitive values are immutable 
- any operation performed on a primitive returns a new primitive 
- objects are mutable, certain operations can change the object in place and any variable referencing it will see the change

## Primitive methods (non mutating):

.concat() adds to string returning new string
.repeat()
.toUpperCase()
.replace()

## Object methods (mutating):

.push()
