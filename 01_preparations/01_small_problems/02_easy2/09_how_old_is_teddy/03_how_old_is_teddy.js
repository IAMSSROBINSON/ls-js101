// Further Exploration
// The randomBetween function used the Math.floor() method. Would it make a difference if the Math.round() method was used instead?

// Also, how can we make the function more robust? What if the user inadvertently gave the inputs in reverse order (i.e., the value passed to min was greater than max)?
