// Further Exploration
// You may have noticed that the solution continues iterating until index points to the last character in the string, which means that text[index + 1] is beyond the end of the string during the last iteration. Why does it do this? What happens if we stop iterating when index is equal to text.length - 1?

// It's also possible to solve this using regular expressions. For a nice challenge, give this a try with regular expressions. Can you think of any other solutions that don't use regular expressions?
